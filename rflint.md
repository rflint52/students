I am Ryan Flint, and this is my final semester as a graduate student in CS at UTK. I have a strong interest in cybersecurity, specifically in software and web security. This
summer, I was given the opportunity to participate in research with Dr. Scott Ruoti. Under his direction, I and another student continued development on an in-house tool to
perform "security audits" of target websites to determine how vulnerable they are.
My passion for computer science arose during middle school, where I was exposed to Scratch (an application that facilitates programming by means of drag-and-drop puzzle
pieces).
